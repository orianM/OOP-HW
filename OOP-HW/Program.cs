            /*Object Oriented Programming or OOP for short, is: A way of programming - that helps develop code and
              solve problems from a realistic approach (Meaning: how we would handle a problem if we were to meet
              it in our daily lives). Instead of looking at our code as some meaningless ability we want to execute.
              
              OOP works using categories(parent) & subcategories(child) in our code -  by using "objects & classes"
              and giving them "fields & properties". 
              you can modify/change any object and give it specific properties.
            
              for example: if you were to make program that gives information about different types of vehicles -
              trains, cars and bicycles their parent category would be "Vehicles" and will include a "field" which
              all those vehicles have like wheels and then create a subcategory for each since they all have different
              sized/shaped wheels.

              That way you can add more and more types of vehicles (planes, tractors, trucks),
              you would create a subcategory for each one, and the program will know that the main category is:
              vehicles.*/
